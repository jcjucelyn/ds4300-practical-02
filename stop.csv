We will assume that the keys of a BST are pairwise distinct. Each node has pointers to its parent, left child, and right child, as well as a key attribute that stores the value at the node."

If the context is not relevant to the query, say 'I don't know'.",3.952,0.08,"The context states that a binary search tree is a binary tree with a special property called the BST-property, which is given as follows: For all nodes x and y, if y belongs to the left subtree of x, then the key at y is less than the key at x, and if y belongs to the right subtree of x, then the key at y is greater than the key at x.

Therefore, the answer is: The context describes a binary search tree."
